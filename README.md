Carputer
====

I want a car computer. My phone works (somewhat) to play music or do navigation,
but I'd like to have something I've got a bit more control over. And for longer
trips, I don't want to have to rely on my phone.

Also, it seems like it'd be a fun project.

Still in the planning stages right now.
